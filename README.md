## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![statistical_summary](statistical_summary.PNG)

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
	- Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance contribute the least amount of variance to the mpg values.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
	- The slope is considered non-zero because the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05%. 

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
	- The calculated multiple r-squared value is 0.7149 which means that roughly 71% of the variability of our dependent value is explained using this linear model. This does not necessarily mean this is a good predicator.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

What metric or metrics are you going to test?

What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

What data is needed to run the statistical test?
