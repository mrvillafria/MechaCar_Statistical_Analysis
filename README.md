## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance contribute the least amount of variance to the mpg values

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope is non-zero because Vehicle Length (6.267) and Ground Clearance (3.546) have non-zero coefficients

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
